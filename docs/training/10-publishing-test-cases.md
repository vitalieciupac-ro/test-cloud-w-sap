# Publishing Test Cases

To publish test cases created in Studio, you must set them as **publishable**, because both test cases and data-driven test cases are created as drafts by default.

!!! example "Guided walkthrough"
    **Business case:** Imagine you're a Test Automation Engineer on an SAP team. You've created a test case that displays purchase orders in transaction ME23N and checks the account assignment and location of Line Item 1 for different POs. Now you want to link it to Test Manager, publish it to Orchestrator, and upload the results directly to Test Manager.

    Before you start, make sure you have:

    ✅ Access to your SAP system through SAP GUI for Windows.

    ✅ Access to Orchestrator and Test Manager in Automation Cloud.

    ✅ The Assistant connected to your Orchestrator instance.

    If you haven't already, go back and complete the data-driven test case guided practice first.

    ### Step 1 — Set your test case as publishable

    Select the test case, right-click, and choose **Set as publishable**.

    !!! note
        You can select multiple test cases and set them as publishable at once.

    ### Step 2 — Publish the test case

    Publish the test case to Orchestrator by clicking **Publish** on the ribbon.

    Add the project name and the version you'd like to publish as.

    ### Nice work!

    You've successfully published the test case to Orchestrator.

!!! warning "Before you publish"
    Make sure your Robot or Assistant is connected — publishing to Orchestrator requires it.
